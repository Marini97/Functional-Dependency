# Data Profiling Project

This project is part of the "Data Profiling" topic for the course "Advanced Topics in Computer Science" at the University of Roma Tre.

We want to build an interactive tool that:
- Accepts csv-files as input.
- Computes Functional Dependencies (FDs) on the table.
- Scores the FDs and lets the user select a FD.
- Visualizes the result of a normalization based on the selected FD.
